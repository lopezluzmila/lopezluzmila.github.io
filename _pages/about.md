Hello, I am an economist specialized in public budget and I have worked monitoring and providing technical assistance in main stages of the budget cyclein to entities of the three levels of government (Ministries, regional governments and local governments). My main fields of interest are Public Financial Management as a tool to implement public policies and the roles of political institutions during budgeting decisions.

My inbox is always open. Whether you have a question about public buget or just want to say hi, Iâ€™ll try my best to get back to you!

## Ongoing activities
I am currently working on a [ Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/ml_book/), where we can see tutorials using R and Python. The main topics this book covers are: 

* Prediction/Inference with High Dimensional Linear Models
* Prediction in Modern Nonlinear Regressions (Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks)
* Randomized Control Trials
* Causal DAGs
* Double/debiased Machine Learning
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Trees
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Forest
* Feature Engineering With Deep Learning for Causal and Predictive Inference

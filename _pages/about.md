Ejemplo I am a Junior Researcher at the World Bank in the ID4D team and Lecturer in the Department of Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). I got my bachelor's degree in economics at PUCP and my Master's degree in Quantitative Economics at the University of Munich. I worked as RA in the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition (MPI), MIT Sloan, and Visiting Scholar at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH). My main fields of interest are Labor Economics, Microeconometrics, and the intersection of Machine Learning and Causal Inference.

## Ejemplo Causal Inference and Machine Learning Book
I am currently working on a [ Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/ml_book/), where we can see tutorials using R and Python. The main topics this book covers are: 

* Prediction/Inference with High Dimensional Linear Models
* Prediction in Modern Nonlinear Regressions (Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks)
* Randomized Control Trials
* Causal DAGs
* Double/debiased Machine Learning
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Trees
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Forest
* Feature Engineering With Deep Learning for Causal and Predictive Inference

[Script](https://github.com/lopezluzmila/Scraper_SUNEDU/blob/main/Scraper_SUNEDU.ipynb):  This scraper was created for the webpage of the [Superintendencia Nacional de Educación Superior Universitaria (SUNEDU)]'(https://enlinea.sunedu.gob.pe/). From this information, using Google API Geocoding and Google API Directions, I found the driving travel time and distance from universities to department centroids considering three options of traffic_model variable: best_guess, pessimistic, and optimistic.

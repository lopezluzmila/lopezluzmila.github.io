# About Me
Hello, I’m an economist specialized in public budget and I’ve worked monitoring and providing technical assistance in main stages of the budget cyclein to entities of the three levels of government (Ministries, regional governments and local governments). My main fields of interest are Public Financial Management as a tool to implement public policies and the roles of political institutions during budgeting decisions.

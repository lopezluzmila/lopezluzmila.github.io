# About Me
ejemplo I am a Junior Researcher at the World Bank in the ID4D team and Lecturer in the Department of Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). I got my bachelor's degree in economics at PUCP and my Master's degree in Quantitative Economics at the University of Munich. I worked as RA in the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition ([MPI](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/)), MIT Sloan, and Visiting Scholar at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard ([LISH](https://lish.harvard.edu/people/alexander-quispe)). My main fields of interest are Labor Economics, Microeconometrics, and the intersection of Machine Learning and Causal Inference. 

## ejemplo Causal Inference and Machine Learning Book
I am currently working in a [ Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/ml_book/), where we can see tutorials using R and Python. The main topics this book covers are: 

* Prediction/Inference with High Dimensional Linear Models
* Prediction in Modern Nonlinear Regressions (Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks)
* Randomized Control Trials
* Causal DAGs
* Double/debiased Machine Learning
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Trees
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Forest
* Feature Engineering With Deep Learning for Causal and Predictive Inference
